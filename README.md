# Music-Bot
Music Bot with server unique queue system, made with TS, Node.js and Discord.js. Utilizing my new Command and Event handling structure from simmer-devs/Bot-Framework.

To Do:
1. Skip Command for DJ Rank (Doable)
2. Clear Command for DJ Rank (Doable)
3. Queue visualizer with song information (Maybe)
4. Figure out why the last 10-15 seconds of songs skip
