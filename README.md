# Music-Bot
Music Bot with server unique queue system, made with TS, Node.js and Discord.js. Utilizing my new Command and Event handling structure from simmer-devs/Bot-Framework. Includes paginated Help menu created using reaction collectors.

To Do:
1. Skip Command for DJ Rank (Doable)
2. Clear Command for DJ Rank (Doable)
3. Queue visualizer with song information (Maybe)
4. Handle YouTube Playlists (Maybe)
5. Figure out why the last 10-15 seconds of songs skip
